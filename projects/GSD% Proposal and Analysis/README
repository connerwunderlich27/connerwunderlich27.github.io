# Good Swing Decision Percentage (GSD%)

## Overview

Good Swing Decision Percentage (GSD%) is a metric designed to evaluate a hitter’s ability to make *high-quality swing decisions* based on context and pitch location. Traditional plate-discipline metrics like Swing%, Zone%, and Chase% fail to capture the nuanced reality of hitting—especially the fact that a “good” decision changes dramatically with the count.

GSD% improves on existing measures by defining a **“good swing” dynamically** based on game state:

- **Before two strikes:** A swing is considered good only if the pitch is located within the hitter’s **pre-strikes sweet­spot**, a region defined using each player’s batted-ball performance.
- **With two strikes:** The definition widens to include *any pitch in or just outside the strike zone* (the zone plus a 1-inch margin), reflecting the reality that hitters must expand the zone to protect the plate.

This gives GSD% the ability to reward hitters who correctly identify hittable pitches early while also rewarding survival mode with two strikes.

## Why GSD% Matters

### 🔍 Limitations of existing metrics  
- **Chase%** penalizes hitters for expanding the zone with two strikes — even though this is often the *correct* decision.  
- **Swing%** and **Zone%** ignore context and treat all pitches equally.  
- Quality-of-contact metrics say nothing about the underlying decision that caused the swing.

### 🚀 What GSD% captures
- Selective aggression early in the count  
- Appropriately defensive swings with two strikes  
- Decision-making skill independent of contact quality  
- Hitter approach and discipline in a way applicable to scouting and player development

## How GSD% Is Calculated

A swing is labeled “good” if:

1. **Before two strikes:**  
   The pitch is inside the hitter’s sweet-spot region  
   (constructed from heat map data on best-performing contact areas)

2. **With two strikes:**  
   The pitch is inside the **strike zone + 1 inch** in all directions

Then:

**GSD% = Good Swings / Total Swings**

## Methodology Summary

The analysis consisted of:

1. **Data extraction** from a pitch tracking database  
2. **Classification of swing decisions** using SQL  
3. **Labeling good/non-good swings based on pitch location + count**  
4. **Constructing hitter sweet-spot regions** using historical performance  
5. **Calculating GSD% per hitter**  
6. **Comparing GSD% to traditional metrics** (Chase%, ZoneSwing%, etc.)

# Fantasy Football Mock Draft Simulator  
A customizable, data-driven mock draft experience built with Python + Streamlit

---

## Overview

Most fantasy football mock draft tools (ESPN, Sleeper, Yahoo) produce the same predictable results every time.  
As a competitive fantasy player, I wanted a simulator that:

- Behaves like real humans with natural biases  
- Introduces controlled randomness  
- Adjusts to league-specific rules  
- Visualizes the draft on an interactive draft board

So I built my own.

This project simulates a full fantasy draft using a custom-built Python engine and Streamlit UI.  
Bots have adjustable personalities, positional preferences, stacking tendencies, team fandom, and chaos levels.  
The draft board updates live with every pick, creating a realistic, dynamic mock draft environment.

##  Features

### Dynamic Bot Personalities
Bots are not robotic. They behave differently based on configurable traits:
- Balanced
- RB Enthusiast
- Elite Onesie Drafter
- Upside Drafter (rookie heavy)
- Team Super Fan
- Chaos Bot (maximum randomness)

Each bot is driven by:
- Position preferences  
- Rookie preference  
- Team-specific bias  
- Stacking logic (QB ↔ WR/TE)  
- Controlled randomness that increases later in the draft  

These allow the user to customize their experience to mirror their specific league members and their tendencies.

### Draft Board

The app includes a fully custom HTML/CSS draft board:

- Teams across the top (with bot personas)  
- Rounds down the side  
- Each player pick appears as a color-coded card
- Shows round.pick format 
- Designed with a dark gray + red visual theme  

This creates a clean, simple draft visualization.

### Custom Lineup + League Settings

Before drafting, the user can configure:
- Number of teams  
- Number of rounds  
- Draft slot  
- Starting lineup requirements:
  - RB slots (2–4)
  - WR slots (2–4)
  - FLEX slots (0–4)
  - SUPERFLEX slots (0–4)

The app prevents drafts from being shorter than the required starting lineup, and allows the user to mirror their league settings.

### Under the Hood (Technical Highlights)

#### Project stack
- Python
- Streamlit (UI)
- Pandas (ADP data + player pool)
- Custom draft engine (pure logic)
- HTML/CSS injection for dynamic UI rendering  

#### Key algorithms
- Player scoring system combining:
  - ADP  
  - Positional preferences  
  - Rookie/team bias  
  - Stacking bonuses  
  - Roster-aware constraints (QB/TE caps, RB/WR balance)
  - Round-based noise scaling  

- Snake draft logic  
- User interception (pauses bots automatically at user turn)

These settings make each draft feel like the real thing, with variance and logic akin to human drafts.

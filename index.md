**Sports Analytics • Data Science • Fantasy and Sports Betting**

Hi, I’m Conner – a Statistics student at Mizzou focused on turning messy sports data into clean, usable tools and insights. I’ve worked with basketball, baseball, and fantasy football data, building everything from custom metrics to interactive apps.

This site highlights three projects that represent how I like to work:  
pairing **sports domain knowledge** with **clean code and stats**.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Fantasy Football Mock Draft Simulator (Python · Streamlit)

An interactive mock draft simulator that uses ADP data, snake-draft logic, and configurable bot personalities to create realistic, non-repetitive fantasy drafts.

- ADP-driven player pool loaded from CSV  
- Snake draft logic with team/round tracking  
- Bot behavior controlled by position preferences, team fandom, stacking bonuses, and controlled randomness  
- Sleeper-style draft board UI and live lineup mapping (QB/RB/WR/TE/FLEX/SFLEX)

### 2. OKC Thunder Schedule & Travel Analysis (NBA Analytics)

An analysis of the Oklahoma City Thunder’s schedule that quantifies travel load, rest advantage, and opponent strength across a season.

- Modeled travel distance, back-to-backs, and rest days  
- Built schedule difficulty metrics using opponent quality and fatigue factors  
- Visualized stress points of the season with plots and/or dashboards

### 3. GSD% – A Contact-Quality Metric in Baseball (Sabermetrics)

A research-style project introducing GSD% (Good Swing Decision Percentage) as an alternative way to evaluate a hitter's approach and discipline. 

- Used Statcast data and hot zones define GSD%  
- Tested relationships to outcomes (e.g., BB%, P/PA, etc.)  
- Included uncertainty via statistical modeling and visualization
